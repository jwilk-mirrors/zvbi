0.3

Packager information

Version 0.3 is not source or binary compatible with earlier versions.
To permit parallel installation and compiling with 0.2 or 0.3 versions
the library and include files have been renamed as follows:

<prefix>/include/libzvbi.h -> <prefix>/include/zvbi-0.3/zvbi/*
<prefix>/lib/libzvbi.*     -> <prefix>/lib/libzvbi-0.3.*

Compiling

To compile applications with version 0.3 you must specify the include path
-I<prefix>/include/zvbi-0.3, and link with -lzvbi-0.3. pkgconfig can
provide these flags in a configure script:

PKG_CHECK_MODULES(PACKAGE, [zvbi-0.3])
- or -
PKG_CHECK_MODULES(PACKAGE, [zvbi-0.3 >= 0.3.5])

AC_SUBST(PACKAGE_CFLAGS)
AC_SUBST(PACKAGE_LIBS)

In source files replace #include <libzvbi.h> by #include <zvbi/zvbi.h>.



0.2.3
-----
Bug fixes, mostly compile problems. This version supports the
refurbished V4L2 API for Linux 2.5ff and has been ported to
FreeBSD 4.6, including a bktr driver interface. Basic tests ok,
remains to be seen how well this works in the field.

0.2.2
-----
RH 7.3 build fix (zapping-Bugs-568052) and switch to gettext 0.11.
Libzvbi can now build in a separate dir. Several other bug fixes,
most notable localization works now.

0.2.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.2
---
Bug fixes, most notably the character code range check in Closed
Caption decoder, a V4L2 interface update to work with bttv 0.8.x,
and new handler registration functions (the old ones retained
for compatibility).   

0.1.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.1
---
Former module of the Zapping TV viewer, this is the first release
of the Zapping/Zapzilla vbi decoder as a standalone library.
