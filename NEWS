0.2.5
-----
Hello World. New this time is a vbi_version() function to
query the version of the library. If your application uses
autoconf to configure you can test for its presence with
the AC_CHECK_LIB macro. The remaining changes are bug fixes,
read about the gory details in ChangeLog.

Special thanks go to Tom Zoerner for combing through the
capture routines and fixing some bugs. Unfortunately his
VBI proxy is not yet ready for release, maybe next time.

0.2.4
-----
V4L2 (Linux 2.5) devices were not correctly identified because
the API changed since the interface was first added in version
0.2.3. This version contains an updated header file. 

0.2.3
-----
Bug fixes, mostly compile problems. This version supports the
refurbished V4L2 API for Linux 2.5ff and has been ported to
FreeBSD 4.6, including a bktr driver interface. Basic tests ok,
remains to be seen how well this works in the field.

0.2.2
-----
RH 7.3 build fix (zapping-Bugs-568052) and switch to gettext 0.11.
Libzvbi can now build in a separate dir. Several other bug fixes,
most notable localization works now.

0.2.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.2
---
Bug fixes, most notably the character code range check in Closed
Caption decoder, a V4L2 interface update to work with bttv 0.8.x,
and new handler registration functions (the old ones retained
for compatibility).   

0.1.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.1
---
Former module of the Zapping TV viewer, this is the first release
of the Zapping/Zapzilla vbi decoder as a standalone library.
