libzvbi 0.2.26
--------------

libzvbi 0.2.25, 2007-03-09
--------------------------
This version fixes a buffer overflow bug in the zvbi-ntsc-cc
tool which may cause a segfault on reception errors, and a
GNU/kFreeBSD compile problem (Debian bug #407621).

libzvbi 0.2.24, 2006-11-29
--------------------------
This version fixes a bug in the zvbi-ntsc-cc tool which may cause
a segfault on reception errors.

libzvbi 0.2.23, 2006-10-27
--------------------------
This versions adds a few helper functions to convert Closed Caption
and UCS-2 strings. The raw VBI decoder was modified to handle a CC
signal with incorrect clock run-in.

The zvbi-ntsc-cc tool can now decode all caption channels
simultaneously and converts from caption to locale character encoding
for proper display of Spanish captions. It can write caption and XDS
information to separate files. Some bugs in the XDS decoder were fixed
and a filter was added to discard unwanted XDS information and WebTV
links.

Fixes:
- The library did not compile on GNU/kFreeBSD due to a naming space
  conflict with the RAW macro (Debian bug #372302).

libzvbi 0.2.22, 2006-05-30
--------------------------
This version adds a simulated raw and sliced VBI capture device
to debug applications. The VBI simulation in the capture and osc
tools is more accurate and includes VPS. Functions to convert
sliced VBI data to raw VBI images are public now and an example
application was added. An interface to enable warning and debugging
messages was added.

Fixes:
- Bit slicing of WSS data started a little early. It should work
  better now with noisy signals.
- The WSS capture example used an incorrect bytes-per-line value.
- A work-around for a line allocation bug in older versions of
  the bttv driver was added. Enables capturing of single lines
  (VPS, WSS, CC).

libzvbi 0.2.21, 2006-05-10
--------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- Capturing WSS data from video images failed due to a broken check.

libzvbi 0.2.20, 2006-05-08
--------------------------
This version supports raw VBI capturing with unknown field order, adds
a work-around for a VBI offset bug in the bttv driver, enables
additional debugging messages and improves some test tools. Network
identification now returns CNIs and an example was added. The
CNI (networks) table was updated.

libzvbi 0.2.19, 2006-02-23
--------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- zvbi-ntsc-cc did not use libzvbi but its own VBI decoder.

libzvbi 0.2.18, 2006-02-11
--------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- The configure script has been modernized. Building from CVS now requires
  automake 1.9, autoconf 2.59 and gettext 0.14.
- Diego Petten√≤ added a configure option to disable documentation
  building.
- After make clean src/Makefile tried to rebuild network-table.h from
  http://zapping.sourceforge.net/zvbi-0.3/networks.xml and other
  source files.
- A pointer aliasing bug in the linked list implementation of the
  Teletext cache, which may crash applications, has been fixed.
- In previous versions GCC may not have inlined some bit slicer and
  page rendering functions, making them much slower.
- The teletext filter added in 0.2.17 did not work with parallel page
  transmission (e.g. BBC).
- The code has been cleaned to avoid some compiler warnings (Diego).

libzvbi 0.2.17, 2005-10-07
--------------------------
This version adds missing XDS packet subclasses to the XDS
demultiplexer. The contrib directory now contains a version of the
ntsc-cc Closed Caption decoder from the Xawtv package using libzvbi
for driver access and bit slicing. It installs as zvbi-ntsc-cc. The
CNI (networks) table was updated. The test tools were cleaned up
and a teletext filter was added.

Fixes:
- The DVB multiplexer didn't work right (used by test tools only,
  no part of the API yet).
- The ioctl logger (test stuff) didn't log VIDIOC_G_STD
  and VIDIOC_S_STD.
- test/decode option -a didn't work.

libzvbi 0.2.16, 2005-05-25
--------------------------
This version adds a new demultiplexer to extract XDS data from a
caption stream (EIA 608).

Fixes:
- test/caption, test/osc did not compile due to a bug in the
  configure script.
- Removed a misplaced assertion in vbi_capture_io_update_timeout().
- test/osc, test/capture, test/wss -d option segfaulted.
- Fixed NTSC VBI capturing in the Linux saa7134 0.2.13 driver and
  added a partial work-around here for older versions.
- The HTML export module segfaulted.  Fix by Bernhard Rosenkraenzer.

libzvbi 0.2.15, 2005-03-28
--------------------------
This is a bugfix release. Due to an incorrect bytes per line check
previous versions could not capture VBI data from ivtv driver.

libzvbi 0.2.14, 2005-02-28
--------------------------
This version adds new demultiplexers to extract data transmissions
in Teletext streams, namely in "Page Format Clear" and "Independent
Data Line Format A". A new low-level decoding tool was added for
tests.

libzvbi 0.2.13, 2005-01-23
--------------------------
This version has new, more reliable DVB VBI capture routines.  See the
documentation of vbi_capture_dvb_new() for details.

Fixes:
- vbi_capture_bktr_new() ignored the scanning parameter, always
  assuming 625.
- Include fix in test/wss.c.
- vbi_unham8() return type signedness fix.
- GCC 4.0 compile fixes.

libzvbi 0.2.12, 2005-01-18
--------------------------
Various error correction functions, generator and bit reversal
functions useful for VBI decoding are public now.  A new test app
has been added to capture WSS data from video images.  French
translation update by Christian Marillat.

Bttv drivers 0.9.0 - 0.9.15 report wrong PAL/SECAM field 2 line numbers.
A work-around has been added, and a bug compatible Teletext data
service table entry has been corrected.

If you encounter problems using similarly broken drivers please try a
fuzzy match of driver capabilities and data service parameters (e.g.
vbi_capture_v4l2_new(strict <= 1)) and notify mschimek@users.sf.net.

The test/capture and test/osc apps did not capture PAL/SECAM line 23
(WSS), this has been fixed.

libzvbi 0.2.11, 2004-12-31
--------------------------
Build fix. Cough.

libzvbi 0.2.10, 2004-12-30
--------------------------
The bit slicer and raw VBI decoder have been replaced by improved and
better tested versions. Developers note memory will leak if you do not
call vbi_raw_decoder_destroy().

The raw decoder now supports Teletext system A, C and D and pseudo-VPS
on the second field. Blank line detection has been disabled. As a result
the decoder will run a bit slower but Robin Imrie pointed out that
caption / subtitles may be lost if the signal inserter is disabled
during longer periods of silence.

The DVB demultiplexer added in 0.2.9 is now public.

Other fixes:
- In 0.2.9 i/o routines may crash if passed NULL errorstr.
- Replaced uname call in configure.in by AC_CANONICAL_HOST.
- Missing documentation.

0.2.9
-----
This version contains the VBI proxy code by Tom Zoerner. With the proxy
multiple applications can share a V4L or V4L2 VBI device. For details see
daemon/README.

Distro packagers please consider adding the proxy daemon to the system
init sequence.

Other changes:
- Libzvbi now installs a zvbi-0.2.pc (pkg-config) file.
- Added ioctl logging to V4L and V4L2 interface for tests.
- Extended capture and osc apps for easier i/o testing.
- Added experimental DVB mux & demux. Not yet supported by the
  DVB driver interface due to lack of testing but test/capture
  and test/export use it.

Fixes:
- Teletext decoder: switching between primary and secondary character
  set did not work right.

0.2.8
-----
Updated the network identification table from TR 101 231 EBU (2004-04a).
Incorporated corrections by Stephane Loeuillet (bug #942434).

0.2.7
-----
Fixes a bug in the v4l2 interface, didn't work with bttv driver 0.9.12.

0.2.6
-----
Libzvbi goes digital! Gerd Knorr contributed a Linux DVB interface.
It's not really finished yet but seems usable. You can try this:
test/capture --device /dev/dvb/adapter<n>/demux<n> --pid 123 --dump-ttx
Further James Mastros improved test/osc and a segv bug was fixed
in the page formatting code.

0.2.5
-----
New this time is a vbi_version() function to query the version
of the library at runtime. If your application uses autoconf to
configure you can test for its presence with the AC_CHECK_LIB
macro. The remaining changes are bug fixes, read about the
details in ChangeLog.

0.2.4
-----
V4L2 (Linux 2.5) devices were not correctly identified because
the API changed since the interface was first added in version
0.2.3. This version contains an updated header file. 

0.2.3
-----
Bug fixes, mostly compile problems. This version supports the
refurbished V4L2 API for Linux 2.5ff and has been ported to
FreeBSD 4.6, including a bktr driver interface. Basic tests ok,
remains to be seen how well this works in the field.

0.2.2
-----
RH 7.3 build fix (zapping-Bugs-568052) and switch to gettext 0.11.
Libzvbi can now build in a separate dir. Several other bug fixes,
most notable localization works now.

0.2.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.2
---
Bug fixes, most notably the character code range check in Closed
Caption decoder, a V4L2 interface update to work with bttv 0.8.x,
and new handler registration functions (the old ones retained
for compatibility).   

0.1.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.1
---
Former module of the Zapping TV viewer, this is the first release
of the Zapping/Zapzilla vbi decoder as a standalone library.
