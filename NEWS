libzvbi 0.2.13, 2005-01-23
--------------------------
This version has new, more reliable DVB VBI capture routines.  See the
documentation of vbi_capture_dvb_new() for details.

Fixes:
- Include fix in test/wss.c.
- GCC 4.0 compile fixes.

libzvbi 0.2.12, 2005-01-18
--------------------------
Various error correction functions, generator and bit reversal
functions useful for VBI decoding are public now.  A new test app
has been added to capture WSS data from video images.  French
translation update by Christian Marillat.

Bttv drivers 0.9.0 - 0.9.15 report wrong PAL/SECAM field 2 line numbers.
A work-around has been added, and a bug compatible Teletext data
service table entry has been corrected.

If you encounter problems using similarly broken drivers please try a
fuzzy match of driver capabilities and data service parameters (e.g.
vbi_capture_v4l2_new(strict <= 1)) and notify mschimek@users.sf.net.

The test/capture and test/osc apps did not capture PAL/SECAM line 23
(WSS), this has been fixed.

libzvbi 0.2.11, 2004-12-31
--------------------------
Build fix. Cough.

libzvbi 0.2.10, 2004-12-30
--------------------------
The bit slicer and raw VBI decoder have been replaced by improved and
better tested versions. Developers note memory will leak if you do not
call vbi_raw_decoder_destroy().

The raw decoder now supports Teletext system A, C and D and pseudo-VPS
on the second field. Blank line detection has been disabled. As a result
the decoder will run a bit slower but Robin Imrie pointed out that
caption / subtitles may be lost if the signal inserter is disabled
during longer periods of silence.

The DVB demultiplexer added in 0.2.9 is now public.

Other fixes:
- In 0.2.9 i/o routines may crash if passed NULL errorstr.
- Replaced uname call in configure.in by AC_CANONICAL_HOST.
- Missing documentation.

0.2.9
-----
This version contains the VBI proxy code by Tom Zoerner. With the proxy
multiple applications can share a V4L or V4L2 VBI device. For details see
daemon/README.

Distro packagers please consider adding the proxy daemon to the system
init sequence.

Other changes:
- Libzvbi now installs a zvbi-0.2.pc (pkg-config) file.
- Added ioctl logging to V4L and V4L2 interface for tests.
- Extended capture and osc apps for easier i/o testing.
- Added experimental DVB mux & demux. Not yet supported by the
  DVB driver interface due to lack of testing but test/capture
  and test/export use it.

Fixes:
- Teletext decoder: switching between primary and secondary character
  set did not work right.

0.2.8
-----
Updated the network identification table from TR 101 231 EBU (2004-04a).
Incorporated corrections by Stephane Loeuillet (bug #942434).

0.2.7
-----
Fixes a bug in the v4l2 interface, didn't work with bttv driver 0.9.12.

0.2.6
-----
Libzvbi goes digital! Gerd Knorr contributed a Linux DVB interface.
It's not really finished yet but seems usable. You can try this:
test/capture --device /dev/dvb/adapter<n>/demux<n> --pid 123 --dump-ttx
Further James Mastros improved test/osc and a segv bug was fixed
in the page formatting code.

0.2.5
-----
New this time is a vbi_version() function to query the version
of the library at runtime. If your application uses autoconf to
configure you can test for its presence with the AC_CHECK_LIB
macro. The remaining changes are bug fixes, read about the
details in ChangeLog.

0.2.4
-----
V4L2 (Linux 2.5) devices were not correctly identified because
the API changed since the interface was first added in version
0.2.3. This version contains an updated header file. 

0.2.3
-----
Bug fixes, mostly compile problems. This version supports the
refurbished V4L2 API for Linux 2.5ff and has been ported to
FreeBSD 4.6, including a bktr driver interface. Basic tests ok,
remains to be seen how well this works in the field.

0.2.2
-----
RH 7.3 build fix (zapping-Bugs-568052) and switch to gettext 0.11.
Libzvbi can now build in a separate dir. Several other bug fixes,
most notable localization works now.

0.2.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.2
---
Bug fixes, most notably the character code range check in Closed
Caption decoder, a V4L2 interface update to work with bttv 0.8.x,
and new handler registration functions (the old ones retained
for compatibility).   

0.1.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.1
---
Former module of the Zapping TV viewer, this is the first release
of the Zapping/Zapzilla vbi decoder as a standalone library.
