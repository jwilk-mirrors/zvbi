0.2.8
-----
Updated the network identification table from TR 101 231 EBU (2004-04a).
Incorporated corrections by Stephane Loeuillet (bug #942434).

0.2.7
-----
Fixes a bug in the v4l2 interface, didn't work with bttv driver 0.9.12.

0.2.6
-----
Libzvbi goes digital! Gerd Knorr contributed a Linux DVB interface.
It's not really finished yet but seems usable. You can try this:
test/capture --device /dev/dvb/adapter<n>/demux<n> --pid 123 --dump-ttx
Further James Mastros improved test/osc and a segv bug was fixed
in the page formatting code.

0.2.5
-----
New this time is a vbi_version() function to query the version
of the library at runtime. If your application uses autoconf to
configure you can test for its presence with the AC_CHECK_LIB
macro. The remaining changes are bug fixes, read about the
details in ChangeLog.

0.2.4
-----
V4L2 (Linux 2.5) devices were not correctly identified because
the API changed since the interface was first added in version
0.2.3. This version contains an updated header file. 

0.2.3
-----
Bug fixes, mostly compile problems. This version supports the
refurbished V4L2 API for Linux 2.5ff and has been ported to
FreeBSD 4.6, including a bktr driver interface. Basic tests ok,
remains to be seen how well this works in the field.

0.2.2
-----
RH 7.3 build fix (zapping-Bugs-568052) and switch to gettext 0.11.
Libzvbi can now build in a separate dir. Several other bug fixes,
most notable localization works now.

0.2.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.2
---
Bug fixes, most notably the character code range check in Closed
Caption decoder, a V4L2 interface update to work with bttv 0.8.x,
and new handler registration functions (the old ones retained
for compatibility).   

0.1.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.1
---
Former module of the Zapping TV viewer, this is the first release
