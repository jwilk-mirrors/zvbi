Version 0.3

* Improve & integrate fake VBI generator. Demonstrate every
  supported feature for tests & localization.
* Add io-dvb. Generally speaking the i/o api is poor, should be
  improved. Take a look at  http://www.baycom.org/~tom/alevt-dvb.patch
* VR triggers from VPS/PDC/XDS.
  - decoders complete, events missing.
* Program info from TTX (8/30 and VPS/PDC).
* Can we replace ASCII/Latin-1/local by a single char set?
  Perhaps UTF-8?
  - vbi_program_info
  - vbi_network done
* Improve TTX roll header + serial (Mxx increment).
* Think about ttx header samples (p100) for stations not transmitting
  a CNI (instead of guessing the name from ttx). May use VTX to create
  samples.

Version 0.3.x

* Better support for custom fonts. For once, a TT font containing the
  Teletext special characters (block graphics etc) would be useful.
