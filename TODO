Version 0.3

* Improve & integrate fake VBI generator. Demonstrate every
  supported feature for tests & localization.
* Events suck badly. Change to query functions (fetch page, station
  name, aspect ratio, ...) and just notify apps of changes.
* Add io-dvb. Generally speaking the i/o api is poor, should be
  improved. Take a look at  http://www.baycom.org/~tom/alevt-dvb.patch
* VR triggers from VPS/PDC/XDS.
  - decoders complete, events missing.
* Program info from TTX (8/30 and VPS/PDC).
* Can we replace ASCII/Latin-1/local by a single char set?
  Perhaps UTF-8?
  - vbi_program_info
  - vbi_network done
* Improve TTX roll header + serial (Mxx increment).
* Improve TTX page cache.
* Streaming subtitles (as opposed to exporting single pages).
* Not relocatable (bindtextdomain)
* Think about ttx header samples (p100) for stations not transmitting
  a CNI (instead of guessing the name from ttx). May use VTX to create
  samples.
* SGML error reporting. (Not sure anymore if this is
  really worth the trouble.)

+ io.c
 + tv_video_device (v4l/v4l2/v4l25/bktr)
   - device enum
   - video input, tuner, frequency table
   - video standard
   - control
   - pixfmt
   + basic open, close, read, mmap, ioctl

Version 0.4

* Better support for custom fonts. For once, a TT font containing the
  special characters (block graphics etc) would be useful.
