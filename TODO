Version 0.3

* Improve & integrate fake VBI generator. Demonstrate every
  supported feature for tests & localization.
* Rename export options: text s/format/encoding. html s/css/sthbetter.
* Events suck badly. Change to query functions (fetch page, station
  name, aspect ratio, ...) and just notify apps of changes.
* vbi_page split into public and private, allocate when fetched.
  - Almost complete, just a new interface needed.
* Finish vbi_fetch_* reference counting. Don't forget POP/DRCS pages.
* Need a replacement for vbi_teletext_set_default_region(), this is
  better done at vbi_fetch_*. And we need the ability to override
  fonts completely, grep Changelog BBC Prime.
* Add io-dvb. Generally speaking the i/o api is poor, should be
  improved. Take a look at  http://www.baycom.org/~tom/alevt-dvb.patch
* search.c: Add vbi_wst_level.
* packet.c: Add filter for data pages (EPG etc).
  - vbi_decoder_hook stuff, not used yet.
* Add VPT decoder.
  - PDC A/B parser in src/teletext.c complete except for
    query functions.
* VR triggers from VPS/PDC/XDS.
* Program info from TTX (8/30 and VPS/PDC).
* Can we replace ASCII/Latin-1/local by a single char set?
  Perhaps UTF-8?
* Suppose Turkish currency sign U+E800 can be replaced by
  U+20A4, Unicode 3.1: "20A4 LIRA SIGN\n* Italy, Turkey"
* Improve TTX roll header + serial (Mxx increment).
* Improve TTX page cache.
* Streaming subtitles (as opposed to exporting single pages).
* Not relocatable (bindtextdomain)
* exp-gfx.c: draw_*_page_region different formats, custom fonts.
* TTX export: Make blockgfx replacement smarter.
* Think about ttx header samples (p100) for stations not transmitting
  a CNI (instead of guessing the name from ttx). May use VTX to create
  samples.
* SGML error reporting. (Not sure anymore if this is
  really worth the trouble.)
* i18n: exporting static strings N_("foo") is a bad idea.
* search: add user_data to progress callback.
* search: a utf8 version would be nice.

+ io.c
 + tv_video_device (v4l/v4l2/v4l25/bktr)
   - device enum
   - video input, tuner, frequency table
   - video standard
   - control
   - pixfmt
   + basic open, close, read, mmap, ioctl
