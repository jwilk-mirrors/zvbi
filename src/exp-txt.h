 * @size: Size of the buffer in bytes. The function fails

 * @format: Character set name for iconv() conversion,
 *   for example "ISO-8859-1".
 * @table: When FALSE, runs of spaces at the start and
 *   end of rows will be collapsed into single spaces.
 * @ltr: Currently ignored, please set to TRUE.
 * 
 * Print a Teletext or Closed Caption #vbi_page, rows separated
 * by linefeeds "\n", in the desired format. All character attributes
 * and colors will be lost. Graphics characters, DRCS and all
 * characters not representable in the target format will be replaced
 * by spaces.
 * 
 * Return value:
 * Number of bytes written into @buf, a value of zero when
 * some error occurred. In this case @buf may contain incomplete
 * data. Note this function does not append a terminating null
 * character.
