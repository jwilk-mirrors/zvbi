 * 
 * @VBI_TRANSPARENT_SPACE: This page is supposed to be overlayed onto
 * video, with video displayed in place of this character (or the page
 * border). In other words the character is a space (#vbi_char.unicode =
 * U+0020) and the glyph background is transparent. If desired the
 * renderer may also fall back to VBI_SEMI_TRANSPARENT or VBI_OPAQUE
 * mode. For this case #vbi_char.background names the color to use as
 * the semi-transparent or opaque background.
 * 
 * VBI_TRANSPARENT_SPACE is the opacity of subtitle pages (both border and
 * characters, while the 'boxed' words are marked as VBI_SEMI_TRANSPARENT),
 * but can also occur on a mainly VBI_OPAQUE page to create a 'window'
 * effect.
 * 
 * @VBI_TRANSPARENT_FULL: Display video instead of the background color.
 * Here the character is <emphasis>not</> a space and shall be displayed
 * in #vbi_char.foreground color. Only in the background of the character
 * video shall look through. Again the renderer may fall back to
 * VBI_SEMI_TRANSPARENT or VBI_OPAQUE.
 * 
 * @VBI_SEMI_TRANSPARENT: Alpha blend video into background color, the
 * character background becomes translucent. This is the opacity used
 * for 'boxed' text on an otherwise VBI_TRANSPARENT_SPACE page, typically
 * a subtitle or Teletext newsflash page. The renderer may fall back
 * to VBI_OPAQUE.
 * 
 * @VBI_OPAQUE: Display foreground and background color. Showing
 * foreground or background transparent instead is not recommended because
 * the editor may have swapped foreground and background color, then
 * replaced a glyph by its inverse image, so one cannot really know if
 * the character foreground or background will appear transparent.
 * 
 * Teletext Level 2.5 defines a special transparent color which
 * permits characters with transparent foreground, opaque background
 * color. For simplicity this type of opacity has been omitted. Also
 * renderers shall rely on the opacity attribute and not attempt to
 * interpret the color value as transparency indicator.

 * </citetitle></ulink> Table 36 Latin National Subset Turkish, character
 * 0x23 "Turkish currency symbol" is not representable in Unicode,
 * thus translated to private code U+E800. I was unable to identify
 * all Arabic glyphs in Table 44 and 45 Arabic G0 and G2, so for now
 * these are mapped to private code U+E620 ... U+E67F and U+E720 ...
 * U+E77F respectively. Table 47 G1 Block Mosaic is not representable
 * in Unicode, translated to private code U+EE00 ... U+EE7F. That is,
 * the contiguous form has bit 5 set, the separate form cleared.
 * Table 48 G3 "Smooth Mosaics and Line Drawing Set" is not
 * representable in Unicode, translated to private code
 * U+EF20 ... U+EF7F.
 * 
 * Note that some Teletext character sets contain complementary
 * Latin characters. For example the Greek capital letters Alpha
 * and Beta are re-used as Latin capital letter A and B, while a
 * separate code exists for Latin capital letter C. libzvbi will
 * not analyse the page contents, so Greek A and B are always
 * translated to Alpha and Beta, C to Latin C, even if they
 * appear in a pure Latin character word.
 * 
 * Teletext Level 2.5+ DRCS are represented by private code
 * U+F000 ... U+F7FF. The 6 lsb select character 0x00 ... 0x3F
 * from a DRCS plane, the 5 msb select DRCS plane 0 ... 31, see

/**
 * vbi_page:
 * 
 * Formatted Teletext or Closed Caption page. Clients can fetch pages
 * from the respective cache using vbi_fetch_vt_page() or
 * vbi_fetch_cc_page() for evaluation, display or output. Since
 * the page may reference other objects in cache which are locked
 * by the fetch functions, vbi_unref_page() must be called when done.
 * Note this structure is large, some 10 KB.
 * 
 * @vbi: Points back to the source context.
 * 
 * @nuid: Identifies the network broadcasting this page.
 * 
 * @pgno: Page number, see #vbi_pgno.
 * 
 * @subno: Page subnumber, see #vbi_subno.
 * 
 * @rows: Number of character rows in the page.
 * 
 * @columns: Number of character columns in the page.
 * 
 * @text: The page contents, these are @rows * @columns without
 *   padding between the rows. See #vbi_char for more details.
 * 
 * @dirty: To speed up rendering these variables mark the rows
 *   which actually changed since the page has been last fetched
 *   from cache. @y0 ... @y1 are the first to last row changed,
 *   inclusive, in range 0 ... @rows - 1. @roll indicates the
 *   page has been vertically scrolled this number of rows,
 *   negative numbers up (towards lower row numbers), positive
 *   numbers down. For example -1 means row @y0 + 1 ... @y1
 *   moved to @y0 ... @y1 - 1, erasing row @y1.
 * 
 *   Practically this is only used in Closed Caption roll-up
 *   mode, otherwise all rows are always marked dirty. Clients
 *   can ignore this information.
 * 
 * @screen_color: When a TV displays Teletext or Closed Caption
 *   pages only a section in the center of the screen is
 *   actually covered by characters. The remaining space is
 *   referred to here as 'border', which can have a color different
 *   from the typical black. (In the Teletext specs this is referred
 *   to as the screen color, hence the field name.) This is a
 *   #vbi_color index into the @color_map.
 * 
 * @screen_opacity: The 'border' can also have a distinguished
 *   opacity. Typically this will be VBI_OPAQUE, but pages intended
 *   for overlay onto video (Teletext subtitles, newsflash, Caption
 *   pages) will have a screen_opacity of VBI_TRANSPARENT_SPACE.
 *   See #vbi_opacity for details.
 * 
 * @color_map: This is the color palette indexed by #vbi_color in
 *   #vbi_char and elsewhere, colors defined as #vbi_rgba. Note this
 *   palette may not correspond to the #vbi_color enumeration since
 *   Teletext allows editor controlled redefinition of the entire
 *   palette. Closed Caption and Teletext Level 1.0/1.5 pages use
 *   entries 0 ... 7. Teletext Level 2.5/3.5 pages use entries
 *   0 ... 31. Navigation related text (TOP, FLOF) added by libzvbi
 *   uses entries 32 ... 39 which are not subject to redefinition.
 *
 * @drcs_clut: DRCS (dynamically redefinable characters) can have
 *   two, four or sixteen different colors. Without further details,
 *   the effective color of each pixel is given by
 *   <programlisting>
 *   vbi_page.color_map[drcs_clut[drcs pixel color + vbi_char.drcs_clut_offs]],
 *   </programlisting>
 *   whereby drcs_clut[0] shall be replaced by vbi_char.foreground,
 *   drcs_clut[1] by vbi_char.background. (You are supposed to convert the
 *   drcs_clut into a private color map of the desired type.) 
 * 
 *   Practically #vbi_char.drcs_clut_offs encodes the DRCS color depth
 *   and selects between the #vbi_char colors and one of two 4- or
 *   16-entry Color Look-Up Tables. Also the different resolution of DRCS and
 *   the bitplane color coding is hidden to speed up rendering.
 * 
 * @drcs: Pointer to DRCS data. Per definition the maximum number of DRCS
 *   usable at the same time, i. e. on one page, is limited to 96. However the
 *   number of DRCS defined in a Teletext data stream can be much larger. The
 *   32 pointers here correspond to the 32 DRCS character planes mentioned
 *   in the #vbi_char description. Each of them points to an array of character
 *   definitions, a DRCS font. One character occupies 60 bytes or 12 x 10 pixels,
 *   stored left to right and top to bottom. The color of each pixel (index
 *   into @drcs_clut) is coded in four bits stored in little endian order,
 *   first pixel 0x0F, second pixel 0xF0 and so on. For example the first,
 *   top/leftmost pixel can be found at
 *   <programlisting>
 *   vbi_page.drcs[(unicode >> 6) & 0x1F][(unicode & 0x3F) * 60].
 *   </programlisting>
 *
 *   Do not access DRCS data unless referenced by a #vbi_char in @text, a
 *   segfault may result. Do not access DRCS data after calling
 *   vbi_unref_page(), it may not be cached anymore.
