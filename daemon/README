Libzvbi daemon

This is a daemon proposed and implemented by Tom Zoerner. Its purpose
is to share sliced vbi data amongst multiple clients using the same
vbi capture device.

Work is in progress. To compile the daemon and related files
./configure with --enable-proxy. make install will not install the
daemon yet, you have to start the executable from this directory.
For a client example see the test directory.
