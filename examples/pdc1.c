/* This example shows how to receive and decode VPS/PDC Program IDs
   with libzvbi. For simplicity channel change functions have been
   omitted and not all PDC features are supported. See example 2
   for a more complete implementation.

   gcc -o pdc1 pdc1.c `pkg-config zvbi-0.2 --cflags --libs`

   The program expects the starting date and time, ending time
   and VPS/PDC time of a TV program to record as arguments:
   ./pdc1 YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM  HH:MM  HH:MM

   It opens /dev/vbi and scans the currently tuned in network for a
   matching VPS/PDC label, logging the progress on standard output,
   without actually recording anything.
