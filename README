  VBI stands for Vertical Blanking Interval, a gap between the image
  data transmitted in an analog video signal. This gap is used to
  transmit AM modulated data for various data services like Teletext
  and Closed Caption.

  The zvbi library provides routines to read from raw VBI sampling
  devices, to demodulate raw to sliced VBI data, and to interpret
  the data of several popular services. It has been written for
  the Zapping TV viewer <http://zapping.sourceforge.net>.

  For installation details see the file INSTALL. Information for
  application writers is available in the doc and test directories.
