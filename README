  Introduction
  ============

  The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
  that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
  to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
  next screen field. The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry
  data, since anything sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed;
  various test signals, closed captioning, and other digital data can be
  sent during this time period. 

  The zvbi library provides routines to read from raw VBI capture devices,
  to demodulate raw to sliced VBI data in software, and to interpret the
  data of several popular services. Basically zvbi offers all functions
  needed by VBI applications except for the user interface. The library
  was written for the Zapping TV viewer http://zapping.sourceforge.net.

  For details on using the library see the documentation in doc/html (built
  only if you have Doxygen http://www.doxygen.org/) and the files in the
  test directory.
