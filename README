  Introduction
  ============

  VBI stands for Vertical Blanking Interval, a gap between pictures in an
  analog video signal. While not containing any picture data this space is
  still used to transmit test signals and data for various services like
  Teletext, Closed Caption and interactive TV.

  The zvbi library provides routines to read from raw VBI capture devices,
  to demodulate raw into sliced VBI data, and to interpret the data of several
  popular services. Basically zvbi offers all functions needed by vbi
  applications except for the user interface. The library was written for the
  Zapping TV viewer http://zapping.sourceforge.net.

  For details on using the library see the documentation in doc/html (built
  only if you have Doxygen http://www.doxygen.org/) and the files in the
  test directory.

  Download

  The latest version, sources and RPMs, is available from

  Installation
