  Introduction
  ============

  The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
  that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
  to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
  next screen field. The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry
  data, since anything sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed;
  various test signals, closed captioning, and other digital data can be
  sent during this time period. 

  The zvbi library provides functions to read from Linux V4L, V4L2 and
  FreeBSD BKTR raw VBI capture devices, from Linux DVB devices and from a
  VBI proxy to share V4L and V4L2 VBI devices between multiple applications.

  It can demodulate raw to sliced VBI data in software, with support for
  a wide range of formats, has functions to decode several popular services
  including Teletext and Closed Caption, a Teletext cache with search
  function, various text export and rendering functions.

  Basically zvbi offers all functions needed by VBI applications except for
  the user interface. The library was written for the Zapping TV viewer
  http://zapping.sourceforge.net.

  For details on using the library see the documentation in doc/html (built
  only if you have Doxygen http://www.doxygen.org/) and the files in the
  test directory.
