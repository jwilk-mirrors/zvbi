  VBI stands for Vertical Blanking Interval, a gap between the image
  data transmitted in an analog video signal. Actually this gap is not
  empty, it is used to transmit data for various services like
  Teletext and Closed Caption.

  The zvbi library provides routines to read from raw VBI sampling
  devices, to demodulate raw to sliced VBI data, and to interpret
  the data of several popular services. It has been written for
  the Zapping TV viewer: http://zapping.sourceforge.net.
  
  For details on using the library see the documentation in doc/html (built
  only if you have Doxygen) and the files in the test directory.

  Installation
  ============

  To build and install ZVBI type "./configure" and "make install". For
