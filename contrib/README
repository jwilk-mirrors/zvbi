x11font by Gerd Knorr

Transcodes the libzvbi internal fonts into X11 fonts:
teletext.bdf	teletexti.bdf
caption.bdf	captioni.bdf

You can install like this (may need to replace /usr/lib/X11/fonts):

for f in *.bdf; do bdftopcf $f | \
  gzip >`echo /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/$f | sed s/bdf/pcf.gz/g`; done
mkfontdir /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc

# may need to:
xset fp rehash
/etc/rc.d/xfs restart

# check:
xlsfonts | grep -ets-

After you installed you can for example start an
xterm with "xterm -u8 -font <font>" and see the output
of test/unicode printed in libzvbi fonts.
