Test programs

unicode
	Prints all Teletext and Closed Caption character sets used
	by libzvbi in UTF-8 format. Purpose: compare against specifications
	to verify libzvbi character code to Unicode conversions.

uclist
	Lists all Unicode characters used in a UTF-8 coded text	on
	stdin. NB this script needs access to <http://www.unicode.org/
	Public/UNIDATA/NamesList.txt>. Purpose: verify the libzvbi built-in
	fonts contain all required glyphs.

glyph
	Prints all Teletext and Closed Caption character sets used
	by libzvbi as PPM images. Purpose: compare against specifications
	to verify libzvbi exp-gfx.c Unicode to glyph conversions.

explist
	Lists all export modules and their respective options. If option
	-c/--check given, tests the export [module] api. Use this to test
	new modules.

export
	Exports a Teletext page from a TTX sample stream on stdin, eg.
	./export "text;charset=ISO-8859-1,control=1" 100 <samples/s1-swr >foo.txt
	./capture --sim --pal --sliced | ./export "png" 100 >foo.png
	Purpose: test teletext decoder and export modules. (Sample streams
	are in CVS zapping/libvbi/samples.)

caption
	Closed Caption test displaying a hello world message or the
        CC sample stream on stdin, for debugging the CC decoder.
	Note this works only on a X11 5:6:5 LE display. The keys
	F1-F8 switch between the Closed Caption channels 1-4
	and Text channels 1-4.

osc
	Raw vbi data visualization. Purpose: test vbi device interface,
	raw vbi decoder. Works only on X11 5:6:5 LE display. Options:
	-d | --device name
			Default is /dev/vbi.
	--sim		Create artificial raw vbi data instead of
			opening a vbi device, to test decoding in
			absence of a real source.
	-v | --verbose	Trace device access on stderr, may reveal
			why opening a device failed.
	-p | --pal, 
	-n | --ntsc	Video standard hint for simulation and v4l.
			When not given libzvbi may have to guess
			which can fail. Default is PAL.

capture
	Capture sliced vbi data. Purpose: test vbi device interface,
	raw vbi decoder. Options:
	-d | --device name
			Default is /dev/vbi.
	--sim		Create artificial raw vbi data instead of
			opening a vbi device, to test decoding in
			absence of a real source.
	-v | --verbose	Trace device access on stderr, may reveal
			why opening a device failed.
	-p | --pal, 
	-n | --ntsc	Video standard hint for simulation and v4l.
			When not given libzvbi may have to guess
			which can fail. Default is PAL.
	--read		Use libzvbi capture read interface (default).
	--pull		Use libzvbi capture pull interface, to test
			if it works.

	Options to write sliced vbi data _as_ASCII_ to standard output:

	--dump-ttx	Teletext data (PAL).
	--dump-cc	Closed Caption data, excluding XDS (PAL & NTSC).
	--dump-xds	eXtended Data Service data (station name etc; NTSC).
	--dump-wss	Wide Screen Signalling (PAL & NTSC-Japan).
	--dump-vps	Video Programming System (PAL in DE/AT/CH).
	--dump-sliced	Everything.

	Options to write sliced vbi data _in_binary_format_ to standard
	output. This can be piped
		"./capture <options> --sliced | ./export <options>" or
		"./capture <options> --sliced | ./caption".
	--sliced	Write sliced vbi data.

The ultimative test is http://zapping.sourceforge.net, the TV viewer this
library was written for.
