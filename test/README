Test programs

unicode
	Prints all Teletext and Closed Caption character sets used
	by libzvbi in UTF-8 format. Purpose: compare against specifications
	to verify libzvbi character code to Unicode conversions.

uclist
	Lists all Unicode characters used in a UTF-8 coded text	on
	stdin. NB this script needs access to <http://www.unicode.org/
	Public/UNIDATA/NamesList.txt>. Purpose: verify the libzvbi built-in
	fonts contain all required glyphs.

glyph
	Prints all Teletext and Closed Caption character sets used
	by libzvbi as PPM images. Purpose: compare against specifications
	to verify libzvbi exp-gfx.c Unicode to glyph conversions.

explist
	Lists all export modules and their respective options. If option
	-c/--check given, tests the export [module] api. Use this to test
	new modules.

export
	Exports a Teletext page from a TTX sample stream on stdin, eg.
	export "text;charset=ISO-8859-1,color=1" 100 <samples/s1-swr >foo.txt
	Purpose: test teletext decoder and export modules.

caption
	Closed Caption test displaying a hello world message or the
        CC sample stream on stdin, for debugging the CC decoder.
	Note this works only on a X11 5:6:5 LE display. 

osc
	Raw vbi data visualization. Purpose: test vbi device interface,
	raw vbi decoder. Works only on X11 5:6:5 LE display.
	-d/--device name (/dev/vbi), -v/--verbose.
