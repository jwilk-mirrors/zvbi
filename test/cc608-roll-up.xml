Libzvbi EIA 608-B Closed Caption<cr/>
test stream: Roll-Up caption.<pause frames="120"/><cr/>

This is Roll-Up caption on<cr/>
channel CC1. You can see four<cr/>
rows of text at the bottom of<cr/>
the screen.<pause frames="120"/>
 When we add a new<cr/>
row, the top row disappears<cr/>
and the remaining rows roll<cr/>
up.<pause frames="120"/><cr/>

<!-- 47 CFR 15.119 (d)(1): "In the Caption Mode, text can appear on up
  to 4 rows simultaneously anywhere on the screen within the defined
  display area. In addition, a solid space equal to one column width
  may be placed before the first character and after the last
  character of each row to enhance legibility. The caption area will
  be transparent anywhere that either: (i) No standard space character
  or other character has been addressed and no accompanying solid
  space is needed; or, (ii) An accompanying solid space is used and a
  transparent space special character has been addressed which does
  not immediately precede or follow a displayed character."

  47 CFR 15.119 (f)(1)(viii): "If a solid space is used for
  legibility, it should appear when the first displayable character
  (not a transparent space) or Mid-Row Code is received on a row, not
  when the Preamble Address Code, if any, is given. A row on which
  there are no displayable characters or Mid-Row Codes will not
  display a solid space, even when rolled up between two rows which do
  display a solid space." -->

These rows do not start or<cr/>
end with a space but the<cr/>
decoder may add one to<cr/>
enhance legibility.<pause frames="240"/><cr/>

 This row starts with a space.<cr/>
This row ends with a space. <cr/>

transparent background, where<cr/>

transparent space. The decoder<cr/>
may replace it by one opaque<cr/>
space for legibility.<pause frames="240"/><cr/>

A transparent space follows<cr/>
the comma in this row,&ts;<cr/>
the decoder may replace it<cr/>

<!-- 47 CFR 15.119 (i)(1): "Each control code consists of a pair of
  bytes which are always transmitted together in a single field of
  line 21 and which are normally transmitted twice in succession to
  help insure correct reception of the control instructions." -->

Control codes (like Special<cr/>
Character Transparent Space)<cr/>
may repeat once to ensure<cr/>

<!-- 47 CFR 15.119 (e)(1)(i): "The first type of addressing code is
  the Preamble Address Code (PAC). It assigns a row number and one of
  eight indent figures. Each successive indent moves the cursor four
  columns to the right (starting from the left margin). Thus, an
  indent of 0 places the cursor at Column 1, an indent of 4 sets it at
  Column 5, etc. The PAC indent is non-destructive to displayable
  characters. It will not affect the display to the left of the new
  cursor position on the indicated row. Note that Preamble Address
  Codes also set initial attributes for the displayable characters
  which follow. See paragraph (h) of this section and the Preamble
  Address Code table."

  47 CFR 15.119 (e)(1)(ii) The second type of addressing code is the
  Tab Offset, which is one of three Miscellaneous Control Codes. Tab
  Offset will move the cursor one, two, or three columns to the
  right. The character cells skipped over will be unaffected;
  displayable characters in these cells, if any, will remain intact
  while empty cells will remain empty, in the same manner that a PAC
  indent is non-destructive." -->

<!-- 47 CFR 15.119 (f)(1): "Roll-up style captioning is initiated by
  receipt of one of three Miscellaneous Control Codes that determine
  the maximum number of rows displayed simultaneously, either 2, 3 or
  4 contiguous rows. These are the three Roll-Up Caption commands."

  47 CFR 15.119 (f)(1)(i): "The bottom row of the display is known as
  the base row. The cursor always remains on the base row. Rows of
  text roll upwards into the contiguous rows immediately above the
  base row to create a window 2 to 4 rows high."

  47 CFR 15.119 (f)(1)(ii): "The Roll-Up command, in normal
  practice, will be followed (not necessarily immediately) by a
  Preamble Address Code indicating the base row and the horizontal
  indent position. If no Preamble Address Code is received, the base
  row will default to Row 15 or, if a roll-up caption is currently
  displayed, to the same base row last received, and the cursor will
  be placed at Column 1. If the Preamble Address Code received
  contains a different base row than that of a currently displayed
  caption, the entire window will move intact (and without erasing) to
  the new base row immediately."

  47 CFR 15.119 (f)(1)(iii): "Each time a Carriage Return is received,
  the text in the top row of the window is erased from memory and from
  the display or scrolled off the top of the window. The remaining
  rows of text are each rolled up into the next highest row in the
  window, leaving the base row blank and ready to accept new
  text. This roll-up must appear smooth to the user, and must take no
  more than 0.433 second to complete. The cursor is automatically
  placed at Column 1 (pending receipt of a Preamble Address Code)."

  EIA 608-B Annex C.15: "The FCC caption decoder rules on displaying
  roll-up style captioning state, "If no Preamble Address Code is
  received, the base row shall default to Row 15 or, if a roll-up
  caption is currently displayed, to the same base row last received,
  and the cursor shall be placed at Column 1." This rule is meant to
  be applied only when no roll-up caption is currently displayed, or
  when no PAC is received between receipt of a Carriage Return
  (causing a displayed caption to roll up) and the first displayable
  character of the new row. The rule shall not be applied while a
  roll-up style caption is displayed and a Roll-Up command is received
  followed by a displayable character, with no PAC or Carriage Return
  in between."

  47 CFR 15.119 (f)(1)(iv): "Increasing or decreasing the number of
  roll-up rows instantly changes the size of the active display
  window, appropriately turning on or off the display of the top one
  or two rows. A row which is turned off should also be erased from
  memory."

  EIA 608-B Annex C.4: "Decoders shall take some action in the
  event of conflicts between the number of roll-up rows indicated in
  the last Roll-Up Caption command received and the base row set by
  the most recent PAC received. [...] It is recommended that decoders
  give precedence to the caption depth when the PAC received is for a
  row number less than the number of roll-up rows. This method of
  conflict resolution shall assure that no caption text is lost
  inadvertently." -->
