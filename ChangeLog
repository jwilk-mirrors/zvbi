2002-03-16	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/Makefile.am: Automated libzvbi.h version #defines.

2002-03-10	zapping-Bugs-527984 <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/io-v4l2.c: Added mmap PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE for
	  bttv 0.8.x.

2002-03-09	Bugfix <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/search.c: Fixed pattern highlighting, used to still
	  skip gfx although now searchable. Segv in reverse search.
	* src/export-txt.c: vbi_print_page_region() return TRUE
	  instead of actual bytes written.

2002-03-02	Misc <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/bcd.h: Extended vbi_add_bcd() and vbi_is_bcd() from
	  3 to 8 digits.
	* src/export.c: strncpy() fix in vbi_export_invalid_option().
	* Dropped the libunicode requirement. Is only needed for
	  ure.c which is needed by search.c. Search is now disabled
	  when unicode is not installed.

2002-02-08	I/O stuff <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/io-v4l.c: Enabled select() for bttv.

2002-01-19	Fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/io.c: vbi_capture_delete() not NULL safe, corrected.
	* src/search.c: Fixed non-regexp mode escape bug.
	* src/ure.c: Added character classes :gfx: and :drcs:.
	* src/exp-gfx.c: Fixed DRCS display.
	* src/exp-txt.c: Fixed color reset (VT100).

2002-01-17	V4L, build fixes <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* src/io_v4l.c: Added missing pixfmt initialization.
	Works great after that, great job.
	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Some build fixes.

2002-01-14	Restored V4L interface, more test stuff, fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/io_v4l.c: Added, *untested*.
	* test/osc: Try v4l2, then v4l.
	* po: Updated.
	* src/hamm.c: Corrected char types (use char only for
	  text, these are ints).
	* src/export.c: Bugfix in option_string(), didn't
	  accept '-' and '_' in option keywords.
	* test/capture.c: Added, from old vbi_decoder().
	* test/sim.c: Ditto, plus new Teletext simulation.
	* test: Updated, misc small improvements.

2002-01-13	Fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* test/explist.h: Option type check.
	* doc/tmpl/sliced.sgml: Corrected .gif names.
	* src/export.c: Fixed vbi_export_option_menu_set(), didn't check
	  for entry < 0.

2002-01-12	Imported libzvbi into Zapping CVS <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Renamed to libzvbi to avoid a name conflict. VBI is an ubiquitious
	  acronym and there are at least two other libvbi's around.
	* libzvbi.h: Now generated at compile time, so we can keep public
	  and private definitions together, autodocs are filtered out.
	  Added version #defines.
	* Separated bcd.h, event.h, search.h. Removed os.h.
	* Prefixed vbi_ and VBI_ a few remaining symbols, attr_stuff became
	  vbi_stuff and fmt_page vbi_page. Purpose to avoid name conflicts
	  since we're going public.
	* New vbi_char (former attr_char) encodes characters as Unicode
	  to improve interoperability. Translation TTX/CC->Unicode in
	  decoder, Unicode->glyph in export functions. This affects TTX
	  combined glyphs, now only those covered by U+00A0 to U+017F
	  can be decoded and displayed. Future Latin Ext-B?
	* exp_gfx.c: Changed PPM color depth from 4 to 8 bits. PNG export
	  now works with Closed Caption pages.
	* exp_html.c: Teletext G1/G3 substituting and Network name in
	  title doesn't exist anymore, XXX should be restored.
	* exp-txt.c: vbi_print_page replaced the string module used for
	  cut&paste. ANSI/ASCII modules dropped, the new text module
	  supports a larger number of character encodings. Improved color
	  and ANSI/VT100 or VT200 sequences.
	* export.c: Upgraded the api to that used by rte 0.5+, which
	  descended from here, so we have roughly the same everywhere.
	* teletext.c: NLSed TOP index page.
	* tables.c: Stripped the country table to what's actually needed,
	  removed the station short names we never used.
	* cache.c: Added vbi_unref_page().
	* v4lx.c: Completely replaced by a more generic version.
	* Copied libzvbi .po entries from Zapping here.
	* Added /test with various verification utilities.
	* Added gtk-doc and wrote some autodocs.

2001-11-01	Standalone libvbi <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Extracted libvbi from Zapping <http://zapping.sf.net>, added
	  Makefiles and stuff.
